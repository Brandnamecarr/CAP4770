# CAP4770
Semester Project for CAP4770 @ The University of Florida

## Architecture:
1. Front-End

    a. React Front End with TypeScript

2. Back-End

    a. Made of 2 Python Scripts:
        
        i. app.py: Acts as the RestAPI for the application- in the form of a Flask App.
        
        ii. operations.py: All the application code will go here (statistics, data cleaning, ML)

## Steps to Run the Application:

1. To start running the React server, cd to the ui directory and type **npm start** 

2. To start running the Backend server, cd .. to the CAP4770 directory, then type **python app.py** 

3. Navigate to [ReactServer](http://localhost:3000) if the user interface did not already pop up
